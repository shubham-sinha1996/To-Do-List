[To-Do List Application]

This project is a basic To-Do List application built using JavaScript ES6 features like events and modules. It allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed by dragging them to a completed list, and clear the completed tasks.

[Features]

-Add Tasks: Users can type a task and add it to the list.
-Remove Tasks: Tasks can be removed from the list.
-Drag and Drop: Tasks can be dragged to a separate completed list.
-Clear Completed Tasks: All tasks in the completed list can be cleared with one click.

[How It Works]

[Adding Tasks]

-When the Enter key is pressed, the task is added to the list.

[Removing Tasks]

-Each task in the list has a remove button.
-Clicking the remove button removes the task from the list.

[Drag and Drop to Complete]

-Tasks from the main list can be dragged to the completed list.
-Drag and drop functionality is used to move tasks between the two lists.

[Clear Completed Tasks]

-The completed list has a "Clear Completed" button.
-Clicking this button will remove all tasks from the completed list.
